# Pig Game

## Description

This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic dice game Pig. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that turn and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

## How to Play

- Open `index.html` in your web browser.
- Enter the names of the players.
- Click on "Roll Dice" to roll the dice. 
- If you're satisfied with your current score, click "Hold" to add it to your total score.
- If you roll a 1, your turn ends and you lose all points accumulated during that turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
